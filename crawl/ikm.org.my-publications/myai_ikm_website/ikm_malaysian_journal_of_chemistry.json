A two-dimensional graph (2D graph) is one of the graphical presentations for data visualization. Over the past decades, Agarwood Oil grade clustering is still at a disadvantage since there is no official standard grading system. Most of the time, an expert grades the agarwood oil manually based on oil appearances such as resin color, smell, texture and intensity. The importance of the agarwood oil grading system will help the seller to stabilize the oil price based on its approximate quality. Besides, Agarwood oil got high requests from big buyers and traders due to its benefits as medicine, cosmetics, perfume and incense. This paper attempts to formulate a better Agarwood oil grading system based on its chemical properties, develops an artificially intelligent k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and trained using Matlab version R2015a. The data acquisition process of investigating the chemical compounds was conducted using GC-MS analysis. From 103 chemical compounds extracted, four significant compounds; 10-epi-\u0264-eudesmol, \u03b1-agarofuran, \u0264-eudesmol and \u03b2-agarofuran were chosen to model the agarwood oil quality. The agarwood oil sample data were categorized into low, medium-low, medium-high and high grades. The findings show that KNN yielded 100% accuracy. Then, 2D graph was applied to plot the sample visualization pattern parallel with KNN accuracy. The KNN 2D plot revealed a distinct separation between the four groups. The accuracy of 100% proved the potential of the KNN model as a good supervised learning classifier towards four different grades of Agarwood oil.  In conclusion, the Agarwood oil quality grading technique based on KNN and 2D graph was successful with the ability of KNN to confirm these qualities into 4 grades.", "Published": "26 February 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 1 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0048", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0048-56479ff"},

However, there is still no standard grading method. Different countries grade agarwood essential oil differently. Traditionally, the grading expert classifies agarwood essential oil by using the aspect of odor, texture, resin color and intensity. Standard grading method is important to ensure the stability of agarwood essential oil\u2019s market value. This paper purposes to proof the capabilities of multiclass support vector machine (MSVM) training algorithms in grading agarwood essential oil. Multiclass support vector machine has been identified to be a very effective tool for classification. The MSVM was constructed utilizing radial bias function as the kernel function using MATLAB2021b. One versus all strategies have been added to improve the ability of SVM to classify more than four different grades. The holdout was chosen as the partition for the model with 80:20% training and testing data ratio. The data consists of 660 samples for each significant chemical compound.

Although hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known as a green reducing agent since it liberates water and oxygen only as reaction by-products, recovery of gold from thiosulfate solutions via H2O2 reduction is still scarce. Hence, this work aimed to recover gold from thiosulfate solutions using H2O2 as a reducing agent. The reduction experiments were carried out by mixing gold(III)-containing thiosulfate solutions with H2O2, and the effects of different initial gold(III) concentrations (10-500 ppm), H2O2 concentrations (0.05-2 M), reaction temperatures (25-65\u00b0C) on the gold recovery yield were investigated. The highest gold yield of over 98% was achieved with an initial gold(III) concentration of 500 ppm and a H2O2 concentration of 2 M at 60\u00b0C.

For biodiesel production, the transesterification of VCO produced using tapai yeast with 0.3 wt% potassium hydroxide (KOH) showed the highest yield percentage at 7 minutes (81.9%). In conclusion, the fermentation of coconut milk using 0.2 g of tapai yeast at 18 hours is the best method for producing VCO. Additionally, transesterification using 0.3 wt% KOH at 7 minutes is the best condition for biodiesel conversion.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-d40deb4"},

The nature of the principal pollutant sources may change from rural to industrial, causing a wide range of environmental problems and competing priorities among water users. The Water Quality Index (WQI) is a numerical metric used to evaluate and describe the overall quality of water in a given water body such as river, lake, or ocean. It is calculated by taking into account on several physical, chemical, and biological parameters/factors (turbidity, pH, total nitrogen, COD, BOD) that are known to impact the suitability of water for various uses, such as consumption/ drinking, household chores, irrigation, recreation, and aquatic life. This study was conducted to determine the water quality status of Selangor River. Water sampling was conducted at ten (10) different locations during October 2022. Heavy metals such as Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn) were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). This study found that the water quality index of Selangor River was classified as Class III, which was considered slightly polluted according to the classification of WQI. The mean concentrations of Ni, Pb, and Zn in Selangor River were 1.4\u00b10.07 \u00b5g/L, 17.50\u00b10.66 \u00b5g/L, and 5.67\u00b10.13 \u00b5g/L, respectively. Moreover, a positive and robust significant correlation was identified between temperature and COD, BOD5 with TSS, and Ni, as well as between Ni and Ammoniacal Nitrogen (AN). The results of this study could be useful to the authorities and government in carrying out continuous environmental assessments so that our pollution levels can be monitored.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-7170490"},

The IONPs were directly prepared via the sodium borohydride (KBH4) reduction method. Adsorption kinetics, isotherm, and thermodynamic studies are developed to design the model for dCOD removal. Pseudo-first-order (PFO) and pseudo-second-order (PSO) models have been studied to fit the experimental data. The regression results showed that a PSO model represented the adsorption kinetics more accurately. The Weber\u2013Morris intraparticle diffusion model was used to analyse the adsorption kinetics data. The plot of qt versus t1/2 represents multilinearity, which showed that the adsorption processes occurred in more than one step. Adsorption isotherms were analysed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich (D-R), and isotherms model. Equilibrium data were well fitted to the D-R isotherm model. The Langmuir model was used to calculate the maximum monolayer adsorption, which demonstrated a value of 69.44 mg/g. Thermodynamic parameters, such as free energy changes (\u0394G\u00b0), enthalpy (\u0394H\u00b0), and entropy (\u0394S\u00b0), were evaluated between the temperatures of 25\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C.

The \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 values were found to be 1.23 kJ/mol and 39.96 J/mol.K, respectively. The results showed that the overall adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous.

Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) was used to demonstrate Pb absorption from the water sample by plant tissue, which are the roots. WH and WL uptake rates of Pb were measured in a short-term experiment. The initial concentration of Pb in the Muar River was 0.514 mg/L. The maximum absorption efficiency of Pb was observed with WL compared to WH after ten days. Pb concentration in the Muar River remediated with WH and WL decreased to 0.104 mg/L and 0.063 mg/L, respectively. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of WL and WH was greater than 1, indicating that both plants were good accumulators. The water was characterized by six parameters, which were Ammonia Nitrogen (AN), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, and Total Suspended Solid (TSS). Our study demonstrated that water quality was significantly improved after phytoremediation by both plants.

Because of their crucial significance as anion receptors, they have also been a target used in the biological and chemical industries as potential materials for separation or chemical sensor. In this study, the addition of a propyl spacer to an amide ligand was utilized to increase flexibility, size of cavity, and potentiality of the molecules as anion receptors. Therefore, in this study, two flexible amide containing propyl spacer, namely bis[N,N\u2019-6-(3-pyridylmethylamido)pyridyl-2-carboxyamido]propane (L1), and bis[N,N\u2019-6-(4-pyridylmethylamido)pyridyl-2-carboxyamido]propane (L2), which were obtained from the reaction between N-6-[(3-pyridylmethylamino)carbonyl]-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester with 1,3-propylenediamine, respectively, were utilized. Combination of typical analytical and spectroscopy techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) were used to characterize these two isomers. Initial investigation on the potential of these compounds to act as anion receptors was carried out using anion titration techniques. The results obtained from this method showed that L1 and L2 have promising potential to interact with dichromate anions compared to nitrate and chloride.", "Published": "30 June 2022", "Issue": "Vol 24 No 2 (2022):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0036", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0036-f014287"},

The char was modified to prepare MC with improved surface properties and to enhance MB adsorption. The surface chemistry and textural properties of the developed modified char were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, vibrating sample magnetometry, and point of zero charge. Raw char and various treated char and MC prepared at different conditions were used for MB adsorption at selected conditions to identify the best performing adsorbent for further testing in the parametric study. The influence of pH (2\u201312), adsorbent dosage (0.05\u20130.15 g), and initial MB concentration (50\u2013250 mg/L) was studied for 30 min at room temperature to determine the conditions for maximum adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of MB using MC. The results show successful impregnation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) on activated char for effective MB adsorption and also for MC separation after adsorption. The adsorption capacity of MB achieved approximately 59.8 mg/g with the maximum removal efficiency of 59.8% using selected MC at the conditions of pH 10 and 0.05 g of MC dosage for 30 min.

Alkyl levulinates can be derived from biomass derivative components such as levulinic acid via alcoholysis reaction. Current research progress on the levulinic acid alcoholysis involves the development of effective catalytic synthesis to improve the levulinates yield. This includes the role of catalyst properties and reaction condition applied during the reaction synthesis. In the last few years, a number of catalysts derived from various types of precursors have been studied to synthesize levulinates from levulinic acid. Catalysts from carbonaceous materials offer several advantages such as environmentally friendly, wide availability, high sustainability, and economical, despite the low alkyl levulinates yield obtained upon the utilization of the catalysts for alcoholysis reaction. Thus, the potential of solid acid carbon-based catalyst has been focused in this review due to the increasing number of applications of carbon-based material as catalyst or catalyst support via various modifications. Extensive research on alkyl levulinates synthesis and applications is required to be emphasized. Therefore, the present article describes the wide potential of alkyl levulinates, fundamental research work, progress research, advantages of alkyl levulinates as a fuel blender, and the future direction for reaction synthesis particularly on the improvement of carbon-based catalyst properties and potential emerging technology.", "Published": "30 June 2022", "Issue": "Vol 24 No 2 (2022):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0036", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0036-57accea"},

Bloodstains found at a crime scene usually occur on items of clothing. Thus, blood on fabric needs to be understood. This research was conducted to identify the types of fabrics that retain a higher concentration of DNA and the persistence of this DNA when exposed to different environmental conditions such as sunlight, high humidity and heavy rain. Three different locations were used in this study to mimic real crime scenes, namely a jungle, an abandoned building and a construction site. Ten different types of fabrics used for this study were satin, chiffon, linen, polyester, cotton, crepe, argenti, valentro, lycra and georgette. The fabric samples were stained with fresh human blood and exposed to different environmental conditions for seven days. Samples were collected every 24 hours. DNA extraction was done using a NEXprepTM NexK-3100 Genomic Mini Kit. The concentration of DNA was measured using BioPhotometer Plus by Eppendorf. The type of fabric that retained the highest concentration of DNA when exposed under three different environmental conditions was crepe. The concentration of DNA retained by the fabric samples in an indoor abandoned building was higher compared to the concentration of DNA retained by the fabric samples in an outdoor jungle area and outdoor construction site.

Natural products, particularly natural extract, are well known to exhibit excellent biological activities, while the inorganic substituents are usually metal ions. Metal ions, especially transition metals, exhibit different oxidation states and can interact with any ligands. Advances in inorganic chemistry provide better opportunities to use metal-based compounds as therapeutic agents. The mode of action of these metal-based compounds on living organisms is different from non-metals. The unique properties of metal ions should be exploited to design new compounds. Pluchea indica (L.) Less (locally known as Beluntas), Clinacanthus nutans (locally known as Belalai Gajah), and Phyllanthus niruri (locally known as Dukung Anak) are medicinal plants that possess various biological properties. Incorporation of transition metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+) into the crude extracts from these medicinal plants would give metal-natural extract complexes of the plants. Leaves of Pluchea indica (L.) Less, Clinacanthus nutans, and Phyllanthus niruri were collected and extracted with either methanol or ethanol and reacted with various transition metal salts to yield metal-natural extract complexes. The metal-natural extract complexes were assessed for their antibacterial activities using quantitative and qualitative antibacterial assays against four pathogenic bacteria, which were Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 117788), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). The antibacterial assays showed that the biological activities of the metal-natural extract complexes were enhanced and selective towards selected target bacteria. It was found that the identity of transition metal ions plays an important role in enhancing the bioactivity exhibited by the metal-natural extract complexes.

Nowadays, recreational use of M. speciosa leaves is increasing and has become a concern because of the lack of information and studies about its potential health risks. This study evaluated the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of the crude hexane and DCM extracts of M. speciosa. Antioxidant activity was tested against DPPH, ABTS, beta carotene bleaching, FRAP, and total phenolic content (TPC) assays. Antimicrobial activity was investigated by disc diffusion and microdilution methods to determine the zone of inhibition, MIC and MBC values. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT assays. Two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MD-231), two colon cancer cell lines (SW948 and HT29) and a lung cancer cell line were tested with the DCM and hexane extracts (A549). The DCM leaf extract showed the highest total phenolic content (TPC) (84.63\u00b19.01 \u03bcg GE/mg) while the hexane extract showed the lowest total phenolic content (74.04\u00b17.07 \u03bcg GE/mg).

The synthesis protocol was optimized, and it was found that the optimum time for the reaction of ESM with FFAs was 15 minutes and the optimum mass ratio of ESM to FFAs was 1:4. Both adsorbents were characterized using SEM and FTIR. The functionalized ESM was found to have a more extensive microporous network structure than that of non-functionalized ESM. FTIR analysis confirmed the successful attachment of FFAs onto the surface of ESM in both ESM@FFAs-NCO and ESM@FFAs-UCO. It was found that the adsorption capability of the adsorbents towards Alizarin Red from worst to best followed the order: ESM < ESM@FFAs-NCO < ESM@FFAs-UCO. Functionalized ESM produced a synergistic effect due to hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions when adsorbing dyes on its active sites. A higher dye removal efficiency was obtained when using ESM@FFAs-UCO due to its greater long alkyl chain content, giving better hydrophobic behaviour. Therefore, ESM@FFAs-UCO was investigated as an adsorbent for other organic dyes such as Rhodamine B, Chicago sky blue, and Remazol dye. The removal percentages obtained were 87.83% for Alizarin Red, 84.59% for Remazol, 78.34% for Rhodamine B and 65.68% for Chicago Sky Blue.", "Published": "15 June 2022", "Issue": "Vol 24 No 2 (2022):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0036", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0036-9ff0707"},

The transesterification reaction is affected by several factors, which are alcohol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading. In this study, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was utilized to obtain the optimal conditions for maximizing biodiesel yield. RSM using Box-Behnken experimental design that consists of 30 runs (number of experiments) and three blocks was developed to determine the optimal conditions of key parameters, such as (A) methanol:oil ratio (20-40); (B) catalyst loading [0.25-2% (wt/l)]; (C) reaction temperature (50-70\u00b0C); and (D) reaction time (1-15 hours). The ANOVA analysis suggested that the quadratic model is significant as the p-value for the model was < 0.0001 and the large F-value of 37.70. The lack of fit p-value of 0.0928 (p-value is not significant) implies that the model fitted all the data. The R2 value of 0.9760 indicates that the model fitted the experimental data. Based on the F-value and p-value of the significant model terms, methanol:oil molar ratio has the largest effect on biodiesel yield compared to other parameters. The optimum conditions whereby the maximum biodiesel yield of 35.45% was obtained were methanol to oil molar ratio of 34:1; reaction temperature of 68.4 \u2070C; reaction time of 11.9 h; and 1.125 wt% catalyst loading.

According to the result obtained, the degradation efficiency of 2,4,6- TCP was directly proportional to the increase in the TiO2 dosage and initial pH of the solution. However, the degradation efficiency decreased with the increase in the initial concentration of 2,4,6-TCP and irradiation wavelength of UV light or in the presence of solar radiation. UV-C, the shortest wavelength, exhibited the highest degradation percentage (88%) compared to UV-B (83%), UV-A (79%) and solar (30%). The highest TiO2 dosage (0.08 mg/ml), gave the best degradation effect (97%). Alkaline solution condition, pH 10.0, gave the best degradation removal percentage (98%), followed by pH 7.0 (97%) and acidic condition, pH 4.0 (65%). Degradation of 2,4,6-TCP using TiO2 achieved remarkable reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) about 82% removal efficiency but no change was observed with the biological oxygen demand (BOD) analysis.

Field burning is the main method used for eliminating rice straw, but this increases air pollution and consequently affects public health. In this study, rice straw was utilized as a substrate for solid state fermentation (SSF) using Aspergillus oryzae. SSF was conducted at 30 \u00b0C, with 70 % initial moisture content and 10 % v/v of inoculum level. The effects of fermentation duration on the total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity were investigated. It was found that solid state fermentation enhanced the extractability of the total phenolic content by 104.4 % and the total flavonoid content by 5.32 % after ten days.

The presence of Naphthenic Acids (NAs) in crude oil is of great concern to the petroleum industry as they can cause corrosion problems in the oil refinery process. In this study, the NA extraction reaction was conducted using 2-methylimidazole in ethanol assisted by a heterogeneous catalyst to speed up the reaction. Calcium nitrate Ca(NO3)2 loaded at a concentration of 10% on an aluminium oxide (Al2O3) support was prepared by the Incipient Wetness Impregnation (IWI) method. The feedstock, obtained from Petronas Penapisan Melaka, had an original Total Acid Number (TAN) value of 4.38 mg KOH/g.

Biofilms can form on surfaces including those of medical devices and cause chronic infections that are difficult to treat, often requiring the use of large doses of antibiotics or the removal of the contaminated device. Anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) isolated from the skin secretion of frogs have been documented as promising anti-biofilm agents. Malaysia is rich in natural resources, including its rainforests, which are a habitat for amphibians. Hence, this study aimed to screen the mucus of the local frog Fejerverya cancrivora for potential antibiofilm agents against the biofilm former Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984. The antibiofilm activity of the mucus of F. cancrivora was recorded at the attachment, maturation and dispersion stages of biofilm formation, and found to be 97.67 %, 54.66 % and 11.21 %, respectively. The active antibiofilm component was then fractionated and further purified by C18 reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to single out peptides with antibiofilm activity.

The average concentrations of all elements, except for Zn, were found to be higher than the threshold levels specified in the National Water Quality Standards for Malaysia (NWQSM). The correlation between the physicochemical data and elemental concentrations were evaluated using SPSS IBM 22 software. Seven strong correlation pairs were observed: temperature-pressure, SPC-conductivity, SPC-TDS, SPC-salinity, conductivity-TDS, conductivity-salinity, and TDS-salinity. Meanwhile, strong correlations were found between the concentrations of certain pairs of elements: As-Cr, As-Se, Cd-Cr, Cd-Zn, Cr-Pb, Cr-Zn and Pb-Zn. Cluster analysis grouped the 15 sampling locations into two clusters, Cluster 1 (low elemental concentrations) and Cluster 2 (high elemental concentrations). The heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and metal index (MI) values were also calculated to assess the contamination levels of water samples in this area. Most of the areas exhibited HPI values above 100, indicating heavy metal pollution.", "Published": "15 June 2022", "Issue": "Vol 24 No 2 (2022):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0036", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0036-3e823ef"},

The physicochemical features and biological properties of chitosan are closely associated with its degree of deacetylation (DDA), which can be influenced by the selection of raw materials and the extraction process. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and antimicrobial potential of chitosan obtained from squid pen cartilage originating from different waste sources, namely restaurant waste (S) and market waste (SS), using chemical extraction methods, with and without demineralization step. Analyses using Ultraviolet-visible and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectrophotometers showed the presence of chitosan in all samples and identified the functional groups within the chitosan molecules. Chitosan yields ranged from 55-82.4%, while the DDA values were between 73.67-76.64%. All chitosan samples demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with inhibition zones ranging from 9.5 \u00b1 0.7 mm to 13.5 \u00b1 2.1 mm using the agar well diffusion method. The MIC values for all chitosan samples varied from 25 to 100 \u03bcg/mL, while MBC values were in the range of 50 to 100 \u03bcg/mL, and MFC values against A. niger ranged from 25 to 100 \u03bcg/mL. The results indicate that chitosan derived from squid pen waste sources exhibits potential as a natural antimicrobial agent, and its DDA remains unaffected by the omission of the demineralization step.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-91c663c"},

Although crucial for infection prevention, the growing use of these gloves brings up concerns about waste management and environmental sustainability. This is because many of the materials used in making disposable latex gloves are non-biodegradable, costly, and non-renewable. Consequently, researchers are now focusing on employing renewable biomaterials as fillers in the formulation of latex gloves. Fillers are essential compounding ingredients in natural rubber latex (NRL) film production as they enhance processing and improve the mechanical properties of the NRL matrix. In this study, corn starch (CS) was used as a bio-filler in NRL compounding formulation as it is renewable, abundantly available, and low in cost compared to other synthetic conventional fillers, such as carbon black, silica, graphene, and carbon nanotube. This research focused on the effect of CS on the tensile properties and swelling behaviour of the NRL film. Different ratios of CS dispersion (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 phr) were used in this study. The unfilled NRL film, which was compounded without CS, was designated as the control to differentiate its properties from filled NRL. In this study, the highest tensile strength and elongation at break were observed at 10 phr of CS loading in the NRL film. As for the modulus at 100% and 300%, the highest value was obtained with the addition of 15 phr of CS, indicating a stiffening effect. In the swelling test, an increase in the ratio of CS resulted in a decrease in the swelling value due to the good rubber-filler interaction between CS and rubber molecules. The increase in crosslinks contributed to higher tensile strength and reduced swelling properties.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-b47effc"},

Furthermore, the effects of essential reaction parameters on enhancing oleyl oleate formation were investigated. The reaction was optimized using the statistical approach of response surface methodology (RSM), relying on a 5-level, 4-variable central composite rotatable design (CCRD). This allowed for the evaluation of the interactive influence with regard to essential parameters in small-scale processing. The parameters studied included the reaction temperature, reaction time, molar ratios of the substrate (oleic acid:oleyl alcohol), and agitation speed, and the responses were oleyl oleate conversion. The maximum yield of 96.00% was accomplished with 3 hours 30 minutes reaction time, 53.9\u00b0C temperature, 172.9 rpm agitation speed, and a molar ratio of 2:24. The comparison between the anticipated and observed values demonstrated a strong alignment, suggesting that the empirical models formulated from RSM effectively capture the relationship between the factors as well as the outcome in the production process of oleyl oleate. Furthermore, the product was verified using spectroscopy methods, specifically Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The absorption peak at 1712.18 cm-1 in the FT-IR spectrum demonstrated the characteristic ester carbonyl absorption in oleyl oleate. In addition, a peak at 173.2 ppm in the 13C-NMR spectrum confirmed the presence of an ester group, further confirming the identity of the product.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-2beb1a8"},

The effect of Nb2O5 on the combination spectroscopic studies (FTIR and SEM-EDX) of the glass were investigated. XRD measurements were confirmed that all samples prepared are amorphous in nature. The FTIR observations show that TeO3 trigonal pyramid (tp) to TeO4 trigonal bipyramid (tbp) group conversion in the TeO2-ZnO base glass was aided by the steadily rising Nb2O5 content. The SEM examination results show the flat surface without grain boundaries and dominancy of large particle grain size. The EDX mapping results confirm the increment of Nb element\u2019s weight percentage as increase in Nb2O5 compound. The density and oxygen packing density increases, while the molar volume of the glass samples decreases as the content of Nb2O5 increases.

Various volatile and non-volatile organic compounds are present in the fruit, which can be utilised to identify and classify different types of pineapples. This study analysed the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at different maturity stages of MD2 pineapple (immature, half-mature, and mature) using headspace microextraction for the extraction method. Optimising the fibre with 50/30 \u03bcm DVB/CAR/PDMS resulted in the extraction of most VOCs during the extraction process. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to evaluate the pineapple extracts. A variety of VOCs, including esters, alcohols, ethers, alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, thiazole, amine, and carboxylic acid, were found in the examination of the pineapple sample. Following that, principal component analysis (PCA), one of the chemometric methods in multivariate analysis, was used to analyse the VOCs from the pineapple sample. The PCA was used to classify the VOCs at different maturity stages of the pineapple, with PC1 and PC2 accounting for a total variance of 74.2%. This study also aims to observe different storage conditions that affect the shelf life of the pineapple. The pineapple was stored at three different temperatures: 25 \u2103, 6 \u2103, and -10 \u2103. The effect of storage temperature on the changes in colour, firmness, and pH was evaluated during the 7-day storage period. It was found that the quality and shelf life of pineapple were significantly affected by the different storage temperatures. The results showed that storing the sample at a higher temperature extended the shelf life in terms of colour changes in the fruit sample. The results showed that estimating the shelf life is crucial for preserving fresh fruits and vegetables during storage. Therefore, the significance of this study is to compare and identify the number of VOCs in MD2 pineapple at different maturity stages. It is also important to analyse how shelf life and storage temperature can affect the amount of VOCs contained in the MD2 pineapple.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-fc83bd9"},

There are a few approaches used to synthesize AgNPs including the physical method, the chemical method, and the biomimetic method. The biomimetic method is the best approach as it is environmentally-friendly and gives off non-toxic effects. This research aims for the characterization of AgNPs using the aqueous extract and methanol extract of C. caudatus. One of the objectives is to obtain a crude extract of C. caudatus by using the cold extraction method before continuing to synthesize the AgNPs from the extracted sample by treating it with AgNO3. This research is aimed at determining the phytochemicals in C. caudatus extract that may contributes to the formations of AgNPs. In regards to the morphology characterization of the AgNPs, the synthesized AgNPs were observed for any peaks generated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and FTIR. There are reportedly five major phytochemicals in aqueous extract including tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, and terpenoids, while there are four major phytochemicals in methanol extract such as tannins, proteins, alkaloids, and phenols. The formation of AgNPs aqueous extract and AgNPs methanol extract was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption peaks at approximately 411 nm and 410 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the FTIR results indicates the presence of O-H, C-H, C=C bands that may contribute to the phenolics and the flavonoids compounds in the extract. In conclusion, the AgNPs have been successfully synthesized through the biomimetic process by reducing silver nitrate with several important phytochemicals of Cosmos caudatus aqueous and methanol extract. The potential of AgNPs may pave the way for a new range of pharmacological properties especially for antibacterial and antivirus properties.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-6eb9129"},

However, a drawback of SFO is its low oxidative and thermal stability, primarily due to the presence of beta hydrogen on the glycerol backbone. This issue can be effectively addressed through a chemical modification process involving esterification with polyhydric alcohol. In the esterification process, unsaturated fatty acids derived from sunflower oil (SFOUFA) were reacted with pentaerythritol (PE) to produce sunflower oil unsaturated fatty acids pentaerythritol ester (SFOUFAPEE). This reaction was carried out with a mole ratio of 5:1 by employing 1.5% sulfuric acid as the catalyst at a temperature of 160 \u00b0C for 6.0 hours. The confirmation of the functional group and chemical structure of SFOUFAPEE was achieved through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. Notably, the results indicate the successful synthesis of SFOUFAPEE with a remarkable 60% yield. SFOUFAPEE remains in liquid form at room temperature. Key indicators of its structure include the presence of the C=O (ester) group at 1742.32 cm-1 and the absence of the C=O (carboxylic acid) group at 1710.60 cm-1, with OH stretching observed within the range of 2400-3400 cm-1 in FTIR spectrum. For NMR, the existence of the ester group was at a chemical shift of 1H NMR at 4.10 to 4.15 ppm (from PE) and 13C NMR at 173.21 ppm for ester. Analysis of the physicochemical properties revealed the thermal stability of SFOUFAPEE was at 354.95 \u00b0C, a pour point of -21 \u00b0C, a flash point of 302 \u00b0C, and a viscosity index of 145.

Producing water-based hydrophobic coatings poses challenges related to synthesising stable dispersions of low surface energy materials and identifying water-soluble adhesives. This study focuses on developing water-based hydrophobic coatings for cotton and polyester textiles using hexyltrimethoxysilane (HTMS) and hexyltriethoxysilane (HTES) via a sol-gel method. Hydrophobic properties were assessed through water contact angle (WCA) measurements and wettability observations. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysed functional groups while scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX) examined surface morphology and elemental composition. Results showed favourable hydrophobic properties with HTMS-HTES coatings, as water droplets formed spherical shapes without penetrating fabric surfaces. WCA values reached 135.41\u00b0 for cotton and 132.28\u00b0 for polyester fabric at a 1:0.6 HTMS:HTES molar ratio, indicating enhanced hydrophobicity.

This study aims to revitalise KLB (60) keropok lekor by replacing tapioca flour with diverse plant-based proteins - chickpea, soybean, and corn flour. The subsequent culinary exploration involves both boiling and frying methods. All cooked formulated keropok lekor was evaluated in terms of nutritional composition, texture characteristics, and sensory evaluation. KLSoybean has the highest protein content (29.62%-30.81%) followed by KLChickpea (25.60%-26.30%) and KLCorn (23.10%-24%). Texture aspects include hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness were meticulously gauged using a texture analyser and cross-referenced with sensory assessments. The results showed that most respondents preferred fried keropok lekor to boiled keropok lekor. Keropok lekor, which comprises plant flour protein is dominant in protein content, chewiness, and preferred for its colour and aroma during sensory evaluation.

PCMs can be classified by their phase change and by their composition, and each class shows different advantages that respond to complex needs, dissipating the heat in a battery. Organic PCMs based on paraffin, such as 1-Tetradecanol, help improve the efficiency and sustainability of the cooling system. In contrast, paraffin wax offers the high thermal conductivity and stability needed for these applications. Eutectic and composite PCMs are a \u201cmade to measure\u201d solution for these needs, and the addition of a PCM to the air cooling is highly advantageous for the optimization of the performance of the battery. It shows the validity of the air cooling in the BTMS, a system intrinsically, cost-effective, and practical in dissipating heat, thus minimizing the thermal stress in the battery. Besides PCM, the paper underscores the critical role of air cooling in improving battery lifespan, safety, and overall performance. The survey reports that air cooling is the leading BTMS configuration in addressing thermal challenges. Air cooling in combination with PCM is a significant approach in this thermal management arena. Among all existing configurations, the encapsulated PCM, metal fins, and the air-cooled hybrid system exhibited the best performance.

However, mineral oils are toxic, non-biodegradable and limited in supply. Therefore, there is a need to find another alternative source to replace mineral oils. Plant oils have been identified as an alternative source to replace mineral oils because they are renewable and environmentally friendly due to their biodegradable and non-toxic properties. However, plant oils also have several drawbacks which cannot be directly used due to the presence of \u03b2-hydrogen in the glycerol backbone of the triacylglycerol structure which makes plant oils unstable at higher temperatures and tend to be easily damaged. This limitation can be overcome by chemical modification through the esterification of corn oil fatty acids with trimethylolpropane to produce corn oil trimethylolpropane (COTMP) ester. The esterification was carried out in a mole ratio of 3.5:1 (COFAs: TMP), 2.9% sulfuric acid as a catalyst at 128 \u00b0C for 3.9 hours. The characterization of COTMP ester has been done using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR and 13C NMR) spectroscopy.

This engine runs at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The research focus about the engine's performance, combustion and emission parameters when using B20 with B20 blended with 25 ppm of Alumina (referred to as B20+Al) against a DI-diesel engine. Alumina nanoparticles were mix with biodiesel using a blend of a magnetic stirrer and an ultrasonicator device. At full engine load conditions (100%), cylinder pressure was known to be highest for B20, followed by B20+Al, superior liken to diesel fuel. The outcomes suggest that using Alumina nanoparticle slightly 5.66% drops in BSFC and a significant 12.5% rise in (BTE), which can be added due to the HRR rate. In terms of emissions, the adding of Alumina nanoparticles to the blended biodiesel led to in reduced levels of (HC), (CO), and smoke associated to the DI-diesel engine due to oxygen present in soya bean biodiesel.

This comprehensive review delves into formulation methodologies, thermal and physical characteristics, and the applications of nanosuspensions in heat transfer. Various techniques are used to prepare heat transfer nanofluids with uniform dispersion and stable suspension. Common methods include mechanical stirring, sonication, chemical synthesis, and surface modification. These methods are influenced by nanomaterials' dimension, structure, and surface properties, ultimately shaping nanofluids' thermophysical characteristics. Thermophysical properties like thermal conductivity, viscosity, and heat capacity are notably improved in nanofluids compared to base fluids. However, increasing nanoparticle concentration increases the fluid viscosity, requiring careful consideration for practical applications. Heat transfer nanofluids find applications across various industries, including thermal management systems, heat exchangers, electronics cooling, and renewable energy systems. They improve the performance and efficiency of heat transfer equipment, enhance thermal conductivity in electronics cooling, and optimize energy harvesting processes in solar collectors.

The ZnO nanoparticles had a flower-like shape, while Fe2O3 had a sphere-like shape. These nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the wrinkled sheet surface of rGO with an average size of particles of \u00b1 14.88 nm as observed via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis exhibits overlapping peaks of diffraction of Fe2O3 and rGO at 24\u00b0, resulting from the reduction of GO. Cyclic Voltammetric analysis (CV) was used to determine the prepared composite's electrochemical properties, which was then further manufactured as a sensing probe. CV analysis revealed that the modified electrode's current response was higher than the bare electrode (ZnO and Fe2O3) with and without glucose.

The attachment of oxygen-containing functional groups onto the GNPs was assessed through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).

One significant challenge is the stability of nanofluids, which can lead to nanoparticle aggregation and affect viscosity. Ultrasonication is a common method used to disperse nanoparticles in base fluids. Therefore, the main aim of this work is to investigate the effect of ultrasonication duration and temperature on the stability and viscosity of MXenes (Ti3C2Tx)/water nanofluids. A nanofluid containing 0.05 wt% MXenes (Ti3C2Tx)/water was formulated by adopting three different ultrasonication durations, namely 60, 90 and 120 minutes. The Zeta potential value was used as an indicator of their stability. In conjunction with visual inspections, the stability of the samples was examined on Day 1, 7 and 30 after the nanofluids\u2019 formulation. On Day 1, optimal stability was observed in nanofluids ultrasonicated for 90 minutes at the respective temperature, with moderate Zeta potential values exceeding -30 mV. However, stability decreased over time across all cases. Extending the ultrasonication duration to 120 minutes resulted in higher nanofluid\u2019s viscosity. The temperature variations from 20 to 60\u00b0C did not show similar trend of the stability for some cases, potentially indicating particle agglomeration with changing temperatures. Hence, more investigations were suggested to get more information of the nanofluids, such as characterization techniques using microscopy. The stability could also be improved via other methods, such as integrating surfactants, varying pH level and nanoparticles concentration, and modifying nanoparticle surfaces and base fluid.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-fdc12a6"},

However, passive targeting of these hybrid AuNPs requires specific particle sizes and encapsulation efficiency to achieve high bioavailability and competency. Varying formulation parameters highly influence particle size and encapsulation efficiency of nanoparticles. Hence, this paper investigates the influences of formulation parameters; drug (gemcitabine-GEM) and gold concentrations on the particle size and encapsulation efficiency. Hybrid AuNPs were prepared by the double emulsion method at varying GEM concentrations (2.5 \u2013 10 mg mL-1) and gold concentrations (2.5 \u2013 10 \u00b5g mL-1). The final product of hybrid AuNPs was characterised using the Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS and UV-Vis, and the results were evaluated using statistical analysis. The best formulation was obtained at 2.5 mg mL-1 of GEM concentration and 5 \u00b5g of AuNPs concentration; in this condition, the hybrid gold nanoparticle achieved 287.47 \u00b1 18.7 nm in particle size; 0.25 \u00b1 0.09 of PdI value; -23.3 \u00b1 0.20 mV of surface charge, encapsulation efficiency of GEM (78.0 \u00b1 0.35 %) and encapsulation efficiency of AuNPs (63.57 \u00b1 0.99 %). Higher GEM concentration reduces encapsulation efficiency because its hydrophilic nature leads it to quickly be distributed into the outer aqueous phase, resulting in lower encapsulation.

This study aims to offer an insight into the photocatalytic behaviour of concrete under ultraviolet (UV) radiation by combining FTIR analysis and RSM. Photocatalytic properties were evaluated by assessing the degradation of Rhodamine B dye on concrete surfaces. A total of 21 compositions of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles were developed using RSM. PD values, which range from 27 to 55%, indicate the self-cleaning ability of the concrete under UV light after 100 hours of exposure. FTIR analysis of high performance concrete mixes showed similarities in peaks at around 1,000 cm\u00ac\u00ac\u22121, which are associated with the presence of silica in the calcium silicate hydrate gel that is crucial for strength development during hydration. Differences in transmittance levels among the samples aided in gaining a clearer insight into the photocatalytic behaviour of the concrete. An analysis of variance revealed that a cubic model effectively characterizes the relationship between PD and TiO2 and ZnO contents with a high R2 value of 0.8353 and an F-value of 6.20, hence verifying the significance and accuracy of the model in representing the relationship between the variables.", "Published": "25 June 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 3 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0050", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0050-cb859dc"},

However, studies on the chemical profile of polychaete species are still lacking. This study aimed to conduct the chemical profile of marine polychaete species subjected to different harvest times using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) metabolomics and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis. In this study, two marine polychaetes, namely Diopatra claparedii and Marphysa moribidii, were collected and analyzed. Multivariate data analysis of the FTIR data via orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed four distinct clusters of the polychaetes were formed based on their different harvest times. Furthermore, organic acids, fatty acids, and aromatic compounds were found to be important in discriminating the polychaete species based on 1H NMR characteristic signals. FTIR metabolomics results suggest that the first and second quarters of the year are the best harvesting times due to their chemical profile consistency. FTIR metabolomics is a useful preliminary analytical tool to discriminate polychaete samples from different harvest times and predict new batches of samples. These results provide basic information on the metabolite variations in polychaetes from different species and harvest times, which might be useful for future applications (e.g., drug discovery and climate change study).", "Published": "08 April 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 2 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0049", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0049-66b710b"},

However, processing has a negative effect on the polyphenol content of cocoa beans, reducing their health benefits, particularly their antioxidant properties. Therefore, the selection of suitable methods or conditions to minimise polyphenol degradation during cocoa bean processing is crucial. This review primarily focuses on understanding the adverse effects of drying, fermentation, roasting, and alkalisation on cocoa polyphenols. Additionally, this paper discusses the influence of extraction parameters on cocoa polyphenols, including method, solvent, time, and temperature. A comprehensive review of the relationship between processing operations and the polyphenol content of cocoa beans provides valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying these changes and outlines the necessary conditions for optimising processing techniques to preserve or enhance the polyphenol content, thereby improving the nutritional and health benefits of cocoa-based products. Past studies have reported the negative influences of processing operations on cocoa bean polyphenols; however, degradation is favoured due to the astringency and bitterness of cocoa polyphenols, which are not preferred in cocoa products. Therefore, more data on processing operations that focus on minimising polyphenol degradation, are still needed for a better understanding of the effect of each processing step on the polyphenol content of cocoa beans.", "Published": "08 April 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 2 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0049", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0049-3765bdc"},

A molecular docking approach was applied to identify plausible binding interactions between goniothalamin derivatives and plasmepsin II. Based on molecular docking analysis, we found that goniotriol, goniodiol, 8-acetylgoniotriol, trifluoromethyl howiinol, and parvistone formed conventional hydrogen bonds with the catalytic dyad Asp34 and Asp214 within the active site of plasmepsin II.

The photocatalytic performance of the immobilised Ag-TiO2 was determined under the photodegradation of Reactive Red 4 (RR4) dye. XRD and FTIR revealed the existence of Ag+ and Ag0, corresponding to Ag2O and Ag-TiO2, respectively. The HRTEM images showed a spheroid shape of Ag-TiO2 with 0.20 and 0.24 nm of d-spacing, representing Ag metal and Ag2O, respectively. The lower PL intensity of Ag-TiO2 suggested a reduced e-/h+ recombination rate, while UV-Vis/DRS analysis indicated strong visible light absorption due to the surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) effect.

However, due to the poor solubility and bioavailability of phenytoin, a large dosage had to be given orally to reach therapeutic concentration with numerous side effects. In this research, the formulation of phenytoin-loaded nanoemulsion was developed as a parenteral application for epilepsy treatment in order to control seizure attacks. The formulation was optimized by a mixture experimental design (MED) and the effects of isopropyl myristate, surfactants, glycerol, and water on the droplet size of the nanoemulsion were determined. The optimum formulation with desirable criteria for the parenteral application was obtained. The predicted response value showed no significant difference from the actual value derived from the experiment with a residual standard error (RSE) of less than 2.00 %. The drug release study showed that 50 % of the drug was released within 3 h of dissolution and the highest cumulative percentage release of phenytoin was recorded at 97 % at 6 h. The sustained release of the drug could be due to its affinity to the oil phase as phenytoin was shown to be highly soluble in the mixture of Tween 80 and Tween 85. The use of surfactants hinders the release of the drug due to its ability to form strong interfacial films surrounding the oil droplets, which can prevent the drastic release of the drug in a short period of time. Thus, the optimized nanoemulsion containing phenytoin has the potential to be used for parenteral treatment for epilepsy.", "Published": "26 December 2023", "Issue": "Vol 25 No 5 (2023):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0047", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0047-959ab83"},

As neuroprotective natural products, carotenoids have shown promising preventive activity, as well as helping in slowing down Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. However, the detailed information on the inhibition mechanism of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) fibril, one of the hallmarks of AD, by carotenoid compounds is poorly discussed in both experimental and computational studies. Thus, in this study, molecular docking simulations were performed to investigate the binding interactions between nine carotenoid compounds derived from Chlorella sp. against full sequence A\u03b242 fibril. The results reveal that the binding energies ranged from -5.3 to -6.5 kcal/mol with binding interactions were dominated by hydrophobic interactions via \u03c0-alkyl, and only two carotenoid compounds, fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin, formed hydrogen bonds. In comparison, donepezil showed binding energy of -6.7 kcal/mol and interacted with A\u03b242 residues through a hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction that involves alkyl, \u03c0- alkyl, \u03c0-sigma and \u03c0-\u03c0 T-shape interactions. Our result showed that donepezil, fucoxanthin and zeaxanthin compounds disrupted the A\u03b242 fibril by disaggregation pathway, which primarily interacted with residues within the hydrophobic (Phe19, Phe20, Val24, Ala30, and Ile32) and N-terminal (Tyr10, Val12, His13, and His14) regions.

The optimum pH and contact time were unadjusted pH 5.61 and 30 minutes, respectively. The removal and uptake of Si-CNT exhibited a double better performance than resin and activated charcoal. For the isotherm study, the Langmuir corresponded to Freundlich with maximum Langmuir uptake at 120 mg/g.

Sunscreen, which contains UV filters, plays an important role in preventing sun damage. Sunscreen protects the skin from UV-induced damage as it absorbs or reflects UV radiation. Nevertheless, continuous exposure to chemical and physical UV filters can result in numerous adverse effects on the skin and the environment. An emphasis has been placed to incorporate natural components such as fruit and vegetable extracts in sunscreen due to their absorption in the UV region, and antioxidant properties.

Five fruit samples, guava, star fruit, sapodilla, dragon fruit, water apple, and five vegetable samples, tomato, brinjal, torch ginger, sweet potato, and onion were analysed for their SPF. The photoprotective activity was recorded using the spectrophotometric method and calculations were done using the Mansur equation. The phenolic content and antioxidant activity of all samples were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu method and DPPH radical scavenging assay, respectively.

The extract of E. oxypetalum leaves oil was obtained via supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide due to non\u2013toxic, lower temperature, non\u2013flammable, economical, and readily available. To identify the ideal operating conditions, the extraction was carried out at different temperatures (40 and 60 \u00b0C) and pressures (20 and 30 MPa) for one hour. At a temperature of 40 \u00b0C and a pressure of 30 MPa, the maximum oil yield percentage (3.2 \u00b1 0.20 %) was obtained. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) analysis revealed that the extract E. oxypetalum leaves oil contained six fatty acids compounds which are oleic acid (30.70 mol %), n\u2013hexadecanoic acid (18.43 mol %), linoelaidic acid (10.27 mol %), myristic acid (6.56 mol %), dodecanoic acid (3.99 mol %), and phytol (3.41 mol %). The fatty acids composition presented in the extract of E. oxypetalum leaves oil have shown possible to be useful for subsequent applications in health and industrial uses.", "Published": "09 March 2023", "Issue": "Vol 25 No 2 (2023):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0043", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0043-650451f"},

This paper reports the compositions of five classes of phytochemicals (alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, phenolics, and saponins) in 36 species of different plant parts (52 samples) collected from Kuala Keniam National Park, Malaysia. The traditional usages of each plant species were also included to rationalize the detected classes of phytochemicals. It was found that most of the collected samples were positive for at least one of the targeted classes of phytochemicals. Out of the tested 52 samples, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, steroids, and saponins were found positive in 7, 11, 30, 23, and 14 total samples, respectively. Interestingly some species parts (ie. the leaves of Uncaria sp. and Cratoxyallum formosus) gave a very high \u2018++++\u2019 composition for a particular class of phytochemicals, and interestingly their reported constituents and biological activities correlate well with the plant\u2019s traditional uses.

Nicotine addiction from smoking tobacco may harm both active and passive smokers. Due to nicotine\u2019s slow electrode kinetics and redox response occurring at positive potentials, there has been a need in designing electrode material for narrowing the electrochemical window for nicotine redox reaction on the current-potential curve. Nicotine oxidation happens at a higher potential making the signal susceptible to interference from oxygen, thus causing inconsistency in the electrochemical signal. Numerous electrode modifications have been attempted to solve the problem of nicotine\u2019s substantial overpotential on bare carbon electrodes. In this work, nicotine in e-cigarette tobacco products was detected using gold nanoparticles electrodeposited on screen-printed carbon electrode (AuNPs-SPCE). The gold solution was prepared from a precursor solution of 10 mM chloroauric acid, HAuCl4. The screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was immersed in the gold solution and was selectively electrodeposited on the SPCE surface at a potential of +0.53 V as the first layer deposition by using chronoamperometry (CA). Then, CA was performed at a constant potential of \u20130.9 V for approximately 900 seconds on the SPCE surface, resulting in a second layer with gold nanostructures. The gold nanostructures were characterised by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Elemental Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). The electrochemical analysis was proceeded using the fabricated AuNPs-SPCE as the working electrode in potassium ferrocyanide, K4Fe(CN)6, standard nicotine in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7), and liquid-flavoured e-cigarette (sample) using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The effectiveness of the AuNPs-SPCE shows the detection of nicotine at a potential +0.2 V focusing on nicotine\u2019s oxidation peak. The oxidation peak calibration graph was linear from 0.00025 M to 0.03 M, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9920 and a limit detection of 8.3 mM within 2 secs of response time.

T2DM patients are usually prescribed antidiabetic drugs, including \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs), but their use can lead to complications. Epidemiological studies have already shown that antioxidant compounds are able to scavenge reactive species and alleviate oxidative stress in T2DM patients. With the main objective of improving the quality of life of T2DM patients, a series of diarylpentadienones (3a-j) and their new pyrazoline derivatives (4a-i) were synthesized and evaluated for their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition and anti-oxidant abilities. The results showed that 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)penta- 2,4-dien-1-one (3h) exhibited significant \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition (IC50 40.52 \u00b1 2.0 \u00b5M) compared to the standard drug acarbose (IC50 543.80 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b5M).

Molecular docking simulations were then performed to reveal several significant binding interactions of the active molecules with the corresponding protein crystals.

The polymers and polymer network assemblies were systematically characterized by FTIR, NMR and FESEM and were investigated for organic dyes adsorption. The IPN hydrogels were strong and stable adsorbents based on their mechanical rigidity and dimension. Excellent swelling percentages (>3000 %) in DI water indicated their superabsorbent properties owing to the hydrophilic polymers, leading to the pore opening within the swollen IPN adsorbents, which facilitates the cationic methylene blue (MB) adsorption onto the adsorbents. In contrast to the low removal of anionic methyl orange (MO) dye, high removal percentages (>90%) and adsorption capacities (~230 mg g-1) observed for MB dye by both PVA/PAA-HA and PVA/PAA-HA/P(AAm-co-VIm) adsorbents suggested selective chemisorption towards cationic species, which corresponded to the pseudo-second order kinetic model.

The data were analyzed using two computational mass spectrometry methods: spectral libraries search implemented in Global Natural Product Social (GNPS) molecular networking and molecular structure databases search implemented in SIRIUS. Classical molecular networking implied that the metabolites giving rise to two features with the highest intensities in the positive ionization chromatograms had distinct MS/MS spectra. De novo molecular formula annotations and machine learning predictions in SIRIUS suggested that both features were sodiated precursor ions of neolignans. Based on the accurate mass of the precursor ions, the two features were annotated as crocatin A and B, which are bicyclooctanoid neolignans previously isolated in relatively large amounts from P. crocatum leaves.

The ethnomedicinal knowledge inspired researchers to search for novel compounds which might be developed into therapeutic agents and this could start with simple in situ phytochemical tests on the identified plant sample. The present paper reports on the alkaloids and flavonoids compositions in different plant parts of 46 species (57 samples) collected from five trails of Imbak Canyon Study Centre (ICSC) and three trails of Gunung Kuli Study Centre (GKSC) of ICCA. The collection was based on the traditional medicinal usage described by the ICCA rangers and some plants of particular interest to the group. The phytochemical detection for alkaloids and flavonoids was conducted based on Mayer\u2019s reagent and Shinoda test, respectively. Of the 57 samples, 11 samples were found to be positive for both alkaloids and flavonoids. While 12, and 13 samples tested were positive for alkaloids, and flavonoids only, respectively. Of the positive samples, the leaves of Eusideroxylon zwageri (belian), Synsepalum dulcificum (buah ajaib), Pinanga jambusana (pinang bumburing), Pycnarrhena cauliflora (pokok ajinamoto), Cinnamomum sp. (madang sarsi), Ixora capillaris (jenjarum), Mallotus mollissimus (bayor) and the flowers of Curculigo latifolia (lamba) showed high content of alkaloids, whereas Phaleria macrocarpa (mahkota dewa) fruits, Aeschynanthus sp. (hoya) flowers, and the stems of Uncaria calophylla (kalait or talait), Orophea hexandra (karai) as well as Bauhinia diftera (bunga api) were rich in flavonoids. It was found that the detected classes of phytochemicals in most of the plant species are consistent with their previously reported constituent and subsequently could correlate to the plant\u2019s traditional uses.

To ensure the integrity of beverages, the presence of permitted azo dyes/food colourants should be monitored to be within the permissible limit. A simple, easily accessible and cheap approach for the determination of azo dyes (acid orange 20 and tartrazine) namely, dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) based on deep eutectic solvent (DES) was developed. DES was prepared by heating a mixture of a hydrogen bond donor (fatty acid) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (quaternary ammonium salt) at 80 \u00b0C with the ratio of 1:3. The prepared DES was added into the aqueous sample solution and followed by a disperser solvent (tetrahydrofuran). The mixture was sonicated and centrifuged to allow the formation of two-layer phases. The DES phase was transferred into a vial before analysed quantitative ly using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Under optimum conditions, the developed DLLME method showed the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.007\u20130.034 mg L-1 and 0.025\u20120.1141 mg L-1, respectively for both analytes.

(Dilleniaceae) have been used to treat diabetes in Malaysia. However, the active principles responsible for the leaf\u2019s antidiabetic effect are yet to be confirmed and evaluated through an in vivo investigation. Hence, a phenolic compound as a flavonoid (wogonin) was isolated as a major compound from the leaves methanol extract and subjected to antidiabetic evaluation. Initially, the powdered leaves were macerated with methanol for 72 h. The resultant methanol extract was subjected to column chromatography to isolate the pure wogonin. Its structure was elucidated through 1H- & C-13 NMR spectral analysis. Finally, the wogonin was orally given to streptozotocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA) induced diabetic rats at three different doses (25, 40, 80 mg/kg b.w.). The histological alteration of vital organs, insulin release, biochemical assays, and blood glucose serum were evaluated and compared to standard hypoglycaemic drug i.e., metformin (0.5 mg/kg b.w.). Data of the blood glucose serum of rats treated with wogonin at 40 and 80 mg/kg b.w. revealed a significant decrease in blood glucose when compared to the diabetic control (p<0.05). Biochemical analyses for all doses displayed no significant difference when compared to the normal group and positive control (p>0.05) for triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density, and low-density lipoprotein. However, the results were significantly different for triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density, and low-density lipoprotein when compared to diabetic control (p<0.05). In addition, wogonin at 40 mg/kg b.w. was found to enhance insulin secretion by day 30. The histopathology data of the pancreas showed that wogonin at 40 and 80 mg/kg b.w. was observed to regenerate pancreatic \u03b2-cells in diabetic rats without demonstrating any liver and kidney toxicities.

The main objectives of this study are to identify the chemical profile of leaf and stem extracts of Christia vespertilionis (CV) using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and to evaluate its antioxidant properties (i.e total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-pierylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging ability). The extraction of the plant was conducted using polar to non-polar solvents which are water, methanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform and hexane. FTIR spectroscopy analysis of CV revealed the presence of functional group of -OH, C-H, C=O, C=C, C-O, and N-H that are mainly attributed to phenolics and flavonoids. The bioassays result of the leaf and stem extracts showed a significant quantity of phenolic compounds, ranging from 1.52 to 5.82 mg of GAE/g extract.

Considering the systematic way to prepare the P. foetida as herbal medicine has not been studied, this project was aimed to evaluate the potential of P. foetida as a natural source of antioxidant by using a rapid ATR-FTIR metabolomics method. The plant extracts were prepared and studied based on different postharvest treatments (fresh and dry samples), different extraction methods (maceration and sonication), different ethanol ratios (100%, 80%, 50%, and water), and different parts (leaf, stem, and fruit). All samples were evaluated for their antioxidant activities and chemical profiles by using ATR-FTIR metabolomics. The ATR-FTIR analysis detected metabolites such as phenolics and flavonoids, which were showed by the presence of functional groups at 3379 cm-1 (OH group), 1713 cm-1 (C=O group), 1651 cm-1 (C=C group) and 1034 cm-1 (C-O alkoxy group). Antioxidant properties results showed that 80% ethanol extract of leaf significantly exerted higher TPC (22.55\u00b13.49 mg GAE/g sample) and TFC (69.11\u00b113 mg QE/ g sample) as compared to 80% ethanol extracts from the stem and fruit. However, there was no significant difference in the DPPH scavenging activity of the different parts. Based on ATR-FTIR metabolomics, three different parts of the plant were clearly separated from each other, indicating that different metabolites were presented in the leaf, stem, and fruit.

The ten types of fabrics used for this study were satin, chiffon, linen, polyester, cotton, crepe, argenti, valentro, lycra and georgette. The soil types used in this study were sandy, silt loam, loamy sand and clay loam soil. The DNA extractions from bloodstained fabric samples were made by using NEXPreo Blood DNA Mini Kit. The concentration of DNA from the extracted samples were analysed by using Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. The DNA in linen fabric degraded fastest in all four types of soil as it showed no presence of DNA on day 15 whilst cotton has the highest retained DNA concentration in all soil samples. Sandy soil showed the highest DNA concentration retention for all type of fabrics except linen while clay loam soil showed the most rapid DNA concentration degradation for all types of fabrics. Cotton fabric was able to retain the pure DNA up to day 10 while lycra fabric retained pure DNA only up to day 5 in silt loam soil. Both lycra and georgette fabrics managed to preserve the pure DNA until day 5 in sandy soil. In comparison, only georgette fabric retained pure DNA until day 5 in loamy sand soil.

This research indicates that it is critical to locate and retrieve any buried blood-based evidence as soon as possible to prevent further evidence loss due to the varying characteristics of the different types of fabrics and soils which could encourage microbial development as well as provide other ways to degrade DNA.", "Published": "29 June 2023", "Issue": "Vol 25 No 3 (2023):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0044", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0044-6ec5607"},

The synthesized sorbents were tested and compared based on the adsorption behaviour for micro-dispersive separation of endosulfan (ESO) in environmental waters using a gas chromatography microelectron captured detector (GC-\u03bcECD). Based on the extraction, the limit of detection (LOD) in decreasing order is GO-Mag-PPy > AC-Mag-PPy > Mag-PPy. This is expected, as the surface areas of the sorbents were dependent on the base sorbent used in the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). When comparing GO-Mag-PPy and AC-Mag-PPy adsorption rates to their precursors, Mag-PPy, the sorbents with PPy addition were able to adsorb ESO more rapidly compared to its precursors. The rate of GO-Mag-PPy (0.50 mg g-1min-1) was 30% higher than AC-Mag-PPy (0.23 mg g-1min-1), followed by Mag-PPy (0.19 mg g-1min-1). From FESEM result, there is a difference in PPy coating on top of AC and GO, whereby GO was fully covered by PPy, while AC cavities were not thoroughly covered by PPy. This suggests different types of adsorptions occurring on the sorbent respectively. Adsorption capacities, represented by qm at Ce= 50 \u03bcg L-1, in decreasing order were AC-Mag-PPy > GO-Mag-PPy > Mag-PPy. It is obvious that the addition of PPy only enhanced the adsorption capacity of sorbent to a certain extent. GO-Mag-PPy sorbent has the lowest LOD for the extraction of endosulfan. A reusability study found that AC-Mag-PPy is more robust compared to GO-Mag-PPy and Mag-PPy due to the physical shielding of magnetite and PPy in its cavities. It was concluded that the molecular structure of the base sorbent influenced the manner of the PPy and magnetite binding, and hence differ in the adsorption trends of ESO.", "Published": "29 June 2023", "Issue": "Vol 25 No 3 (2023):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0044", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0044-ce9d016"},

However, there are challenges in performing blood DNA analysis due to environmental factors and criminal acts that affect DNA stability. This usually happens when dead bodies of victims are subjected to water or land burial. Samples found in such crime scenes often lack sufficient evidence due to DNA degradation or contamination. The aim of this research is to study the persistence of DNA extracted from different types of bloodstained fabric samples immersed in different types of water.  Ten types of fabrics used for this study were satin, chiffon, linen, polyester, cotton, crepe, argenti, valentro, lycra and georgette. The four water samples were from a lake, a river, the sea, and tap water. The extraction of DNA from bloodstained fabric samples were conducted using NEXPreo Blood DNA Mini Kit. The concentration of extracted DNA were analysed with Eppendorf BioPhotometer Plus. Fabrics immersed in tap water had the highest DNA concentration retention followed by lake water, river water and sea water. Among the ten types of fabrics, synthetic fabrics have better retention of DNA concentrations compared to natural fabrics. The concentrations of DNA from all type of fabrics drastically decreased to almost half of the DNA concentration within 24 hours of immersion for all types of water. This study also showed that underwater DNA loss and DNA degradation was very high within the first 48 hours compared to 72 hours reported in previous studies.

However, starch-based bioplastic is prone to have low mechanical properties and degradation due to water absorption. Currently, starch-based bioplastics are often added with fiber to increase their resistance to abrasion, mechanical and barrier properties. The addition of water spinach stem, one of the agro-industrial by product with plasticizer and surfactant, will improve the water absorption, mechanical and wetting properties of starch-based bioplastic. This study formulated a bioplastic using water spinach stem (WSS), cassava starch, glycerol, palm oil, and Tween-80 to produce bioplastic films reinforced from a renewable resource. The percentage of WSS was manipulated through the study to observe the water contact angle, water absorption, and mechanical properties of water spinach bioplastic (WSB). The film was casted in the oven at 80 \u2103 for 4 hours. Then the WSB was cured at room temperature for 24 hours. The results demonstrated that the highest value of water contact angle was 79.85\u00b0 at 17 wt% of WSS content. Besides that, 9 and 17 wt% of WSS revealed the lowest water absorption which can maintain for 2 hours. The presence of lignin in WSS enhances the hydrophobicity of WSB.

Although basic homogeneous catalysts show high catalytic activity, they are hard to separate and unrecoverable. Hence, calcium oxide (CaO) was used as the catalyst in this research. The CaO catalyst derived from waste oyster shells (CaO-WOS) was prepared through calcination at 950 \u2103 for 3 h, and TGA, BET, FTIR, XRD, and SEM were conducted for the characterisation of the catalyst. In this study, CaO-WOS and commercial CaO were used as the catalysts for synthesising GC through the transesterification of glycerol and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The reaction was conducted under identical conditions (DMC-to-glycerol molar ratio of 2.5:1, reaction temperature of 40\u201360 \u2103, reaction time of 3 h, and catalyst loading of 4% molar ratio of the initial amount of glycerol). The crystallinity of both catalysts is identical as similar peaks appeared. The XRD and FTIR results confirmed the presence of CaO in the catalyst. The catalytic activity was compared by analysing the 1H NMR spectra of the GC produced to obtain the predicted percentage molar concentration of GC. The predicted molar concentrations of GC for the transesterification conducted using commercial CaO and CaO-WOS are 97.0% and 72.5%, respectively.

This research aims to extract and characterize the MCC from bamboo fibre (Gigantochloa scortechinii) by going through two different methods of preparation. The first extraction of MCC (MCC-1) was carried out through the chemical alkali treatment by using 5 wt% NaOH, continued by the acidified bleaching treatment. Then, the second MCC (MCC-2) was fabricated via further acid hydrolysis method using 40 wt% sulfuric acid at 45\u00b0C for 60 min. Next, the obtained MCC-1 and MCC-2 were characterized in terms of its morphologies, structural, crystallinity, composition, and thermal stability features through scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses. The SEM analyses illustrate the shape of MCC-1 is long rod-like structure with the diameter is ranging from 14.10 to 14.21 \u00b5m.

Many previous researchers have reported the synthesis of alkyds from plant oils for coatings, that are relatively inexpensive and have good properties. In particular, soybean, castor, linseed and tall oils were very successfully used because they have high level of unsaturation enabling their alkyds to air-dry. The conventional method of alkyd synthesis is carried out at high temperature via the condensation of the oil with glycerol and dicarboxylic acid in xylene, and the use of organic solvent has made the process environmentally unfriendly. Palm oil is a major crop in Malaysia and consequently it is attractive to look into its use as raw material for industrial applications. However, it is a non-drying oil, and its alkyds are not capable of forming coherent film by air oxidation, consequently, palm oil alone cannot be used for coatings. This paper would present a number of selected polymeric materials made from palm oil derivatives. The first approach is to produce a water-reducible alkyd without organic solvent during synthesis. The resin is cross-linked by using a water-based melamine resin.  The second approach is to incorporate palm oil alkyd into conventional acrylate resin.

Surfactants in the glove act to reduce the surface tension and stabilise the rubber particle. However, some of the surfactants may exert toxicity to skin cells. Hence, a series of novel palm oil-based surfactants was synthesised to replace the conventional surfactants in the glove.

These surfactants showed critical micelle concentration (CMC) values ranging from 2.215\u00d710-3 to 3.075\u00d710-3 mM/L with surface tension recorded between 24 and 36 mM/m. 2,5-Diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to investigate the cytotoxicity of these surfactants against HaCat keratinocytes. Agar dilution susceptibility testing technique was employed to determine the antibacterial activity of the surfactants. All surfactants were non-toxic towards HaCat keratinocytes at 1.56 mg/mL.

It was revealed that the water resistance properties of all composite membrane improved as compared to the pristine chitosan membrane, where their water resistance performance became profoundly augmented as a consequence of NaOH treatment. This is ascribed to the presence of interaction among macromolecular chains or with hydroxyapatite as disclosed by FTIR analysis, which was further supported by the increase in thermal stability as shown by TGA analysis.

In general, lanthanum, a rare earth element, can be used to create La1-xAxMnO3, where A represents monovalent ions (Na, K or Ag) or divalent ions (Ba, Pb, Sr or Ca) that are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen ions.

La-based parent compounds doped at the A site (Na, K, Ba, Sr) were synthesised by a conventional solid-state method.

However, disadvantage such as leakage of PCM that causes corrosion of industrial equipment hinders the potential of PCM being used in large-scale. In this study, form-stable PCM was developed using polyamide/reduced graphene oxide(rGO) that was pelletised and coated with nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) latex via dip coating method. Thermal cyclic analysis showed that the leakage of PCM has reduced as the sulphur loading in NBR latex increased. PCMs with two layers of NBR coating have lower weight loss compared to those with 1 layer of NBR coating especially at a higher sulphur loading. The Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and E-modulus of the NBR films increased with sulphur loading due to an increase in crosslink density as indicated by gel fraction studies. The percentage of elongation at break (EB%) decreased as the crosslink density increased, due to restricted mobility of NBR chains. The increase in crosslink density has resulted in increase in gel fraction and density of the NBR films which then leads to formation of compact and continuous NBR coating film on PCM surface as evidenced from microscopy images and functional group analysis.", "Published": "29 June 2023", "Issue": "Vol 25 No 3 (2023):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0044", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0044-73e7da7"},

Lignocellulosic biomass has complex polymer arrangements, making the conversion to various products difficult. The conversion requires pretreatment to improve the derivation of biomass components. Deep eutectic solvent (DES) pretreatment is widely used due to its effectiveness and simple preparation step. In this work, various acidic-based DESs were prepared through the combination of choline chloride (ChCl) as hydrogen bonding acceptors (HBA) and organic acids as hydrogen bonding donors (HBD), which include ChCl/lactic acid, ChCl/levulinic acid, ChCl/oxalic acid, and ChCl/sulfanilic acid for empty fruit bunch (EFB) pretreatment. The DESs were characterised using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and their density was determined. The acidic-based DESs with different ChCl-to-acid molar ratios of 1:1\u20131:5, except for ChCl/sulfanilic acid with molar ratios of 2:1 and 3:1, were utilised for the pretreatment of EFB at fixed treatment conditions to observe the effect on biomass structure and lignin degradation. The degradation of lignin was determined based on the data from UV-Vis spectrometry, while the characteristics of raw EFB and selected pretreated EFB samples were determined using FTIR, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The FTIR analysis was also conducted for selected DES before and after pretreatment to observe the changes in chemical functional groups. The results show that the density of the DESs increased with the increasing amount of HBA used. The FTIR, TGA, and SEM results support the characteristics of the pretreated EFB and explain the possible biomass components involved in the pretreatment process. The degradation of lignin was found to be between 15.0% and 81.7%, and high lignin degradation was obtained using ChCl/lactic acid and ChCl/sulfanilic acid.

Although ASEAN countries contribute significantly to the generation of marine litter globally, there has been limited research on microplastics in freshwater environments. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the existing state of knowledge regarding methodologies, occurrence levels, and the effects of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems in ASEAN countries. Our review focuses specifically on sediment matrices due to their long-term sink for microplastic pollution, with accumulation in sediment posing a risk to aquatic organisms and human health. Based on publications from 2018 to April 2022, 17 studies were examined. Sediment samples collected from rivers and aquaculture ponds revealed a range of microplastics concentrations between 4 and 66016 particles per kilogram. A comparative analysis was difficult because each study used non-standardised procedures and measurement units. Fibres are consistently found to be the most common shape, with black or blue microplastics being the most common colour across countries. Polyethylene or polypropylene was identified as the most common polymer type in the microplastic samples. The levels of microplastic in freshwater ecosystems have been linked to land use activities such as fishing, tourism, aquaculture, domestic wastewater, and industries. The high accumulation of microplastics in freshwater has been linked to the ingestion by fish species and gastropods. Future research should seek to standardise microplastic collection, extraction, and quality control methodologies to effectively quantify and assess the amounts of microplastic pollution for monitoring purposes, allowing for more comprehensive comparisons and evaluation for risk assessments.", "Published": "29 June 2023", "Issue": "Vol 25 No 3 (2023):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0044", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0044-79ce5ef"},

In this study, the diclofenac sodium content in three tablet brands were separated using RPHPLC-DAD and quantified using external standard calibration curve, internal standard calibration curve and standard addition calibration curve. The external standard method accurately quantified the diclofenac sodium in Voren\u00ae (error \u2248 4 %) and Remafen\u00ae (error \u2248 9 %) but not in Remethan\u00ae (error \u2248 27 %). The internal standard method was used to explore the possibility of volume error that may contribute to the discrepancies of accuracy in the sample brands. It was found that there was no improvement in the accuracy as no volume error was indicated, either in the sample preparation or in the volume injected to the RPHPLC-DAD. The discrepancies of accuracy for Remafen\u00ae and Remethan\u00ae due to matrix interferences were explored using the standard addition calibration curve. The accuracy of Remafen\u00ae (error \u2248 4 %) and Remethan\u00ae (error \u2248 2 %) was improved with this method.

When reacting with water vapour, this gas produces sulfuric acid, also known as acid rain, causing environmental destruction, and endangering human health. One option to address these issues is to remove the sulfur from coal before combustion. Physical and chemical pre-treatments using oxidizing or reducing agents easily remove inorganic sulfur from coal, namely pyrite and sulfate sulfur. However, organic sulfur is hard to remove unless a particular reagent is applied to break the carbon-sulfur bonds to release the sulfur from the coal matrix. This study reports the utilization of a mixture of potassium carbonate and ethylene glycol (K2CO3:EG) under sonication to extract organic sulfur from coal. The ultrasonic shockwave separates sulfur from the coal's macro-molecular structure by breaking the chemical connections that hold sulfur to coal. CCD-RSM experimental design was presented to overcome traditional methods that make finding the optimal standard difficult and time-consuming. The effects of molar ratio, temperature, and extraction time on the removal of organic sulfur in coal were investigated, and sonicating coal at 40 \u00b0C for 60 minutes with 1:16 K2CO3:EG was found to be the ideal parameter. The changes to the thiophene and organic sulfate FTIR peaks may serve as a preliminary measure of the effectiveness of K2CO3:EG in coal desulfurization.

Despite their widespread use, there has been little investigation of their structure-property correlations. This study aims to elucidate the chemical, optical and structural properties of various dimensional bromoplumbates synthesized under a closed-system nitrogenized atmosphere without using a glove box. Three different amino(methyl)pyridine (AMP) cations (2-AMP, 3-AMP and 4-AMP) were refluxed at 90 \u00b0C with lead bromide in hydrobromic acid solution. The precipitate crystals were grown via a solution-cooling process and their chemical, optical and structural properties were determined. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of NH3+, pyridinium and Ar-H ions in the products. The characteristic excitation peaks in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the [(2-AMP)(3-AMP)(4-AMP)]PbBr4 series were located at 432 nm, 429 nm and 357 nm. The optical bandgap energy values of these compounds were determined using an extrapolated line from the Tauc plot, yielding values of 2.87 eV, 2.89 eV and 3.47 eV. The 4-AMP and [(2-AMP)(3-AMP)]PbBr4 samples exhibited peaks at 467 nm and 468 nm in photoluminescence spectra under emission mode.

In this study, the tensile stability and ionic conductivity analysis of solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) of different molecular weights, i.e. poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (Mw = 100 and 4,000 kg mol-1) in a polyurethane (PU) blend system, was conducted at ambient temperatures. The semi-crystalline PEO was blended with amorphous PU to reduce the crystallinity of the film, and the conductivity of the system was further enhanced with the addition of lithium perchlorate (LiClO4). The PEO/PU/LiClO4 films at different polymer (PEO100 and PEO4000) and salt concentrations were prepared by the solvent casting method. Tensile tests, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were used to study the tensile and conductivity behaviours of the system. The optimum elongation at break for the PEO100/PU and PEO4000/PU films were 11.25% and 17.71%, obtained at ratios of 50:50 and 80:20, respectively. The elasticity of the PEO100/PU and PEO4000/PU films increased from 54.697 to 20.948 MPa and from 67.393 to 15.980 MPa, respectively. These results showed that the elasticity of the system was enhanced when PEO and PU were blended together. The optimum conductivity values for PEO100 and PEO4000 were recorded at 3.61 x 10-7 S cm-1 and 1.16 x 10-7 S cm-1, respectively, when 10 wt% and 5 wt% of LiClO4 was added.

It is a perennial species grown extensively in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. Lemongrass leaves (LL) are a waste product generated by the agricultural industry that is rich in lignocellulosic material such as lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. Xylose is a sucrase inhibitor which is very useful as a functional sugar complement to inhibit blood glucose levels from rising. Autoclave-assisted acid and alkaline hydrolysis methods were used to extract xylose from lemongrass leaves. The yields obtained were used to determine the most efficient hydrolysis method for xylose extraction. The acid and alkaline hydrolysis of lemongrass leaves were performed using a range of hydrolysis times (10 - 150 min), initial acid/alkali concentrations (0.6 % - 5 %), solid-liquid ratios (1:30 - 8:30) and temperatures (105 - 140 \u00b0C). The maximum xylose yield via acid hydrolysis was 69.57 g/L, under the optimum conditions of 90 min hydrolysis time, 0.8 % sulphuric acid, a solid-liquid ratio of 1:5 and an autoclave temperature of 125 \u00b0C. However, with alkaline hydrolysis the maximum yield achieved was only 4.119 g/L, under optimum conditions which were 120 min hydrolysis time, 2% sodium hydroxide, a solid-liquid ratio of 2:15 and autoclave temperature of 125 \u00b0C.

This composite can act as a bifunctional catalyst for the esterification reaction of kapok seed (Ceiba pentandra) oil. TiO2, which exists as a combination of 90% anatase and 10% rutile, played the role of photocatalyst, while zeolite was the catalyst. The zeolite/TiO2 composite was obtained by the hydrothermal method. A preliminary analysis of its structure carried out using XRD showed that the addition of TiO2 did not change the structures of TiO2 or zeolite. SEM/EDX characterization was performed to determine the distribution of Ti on the surface of the zeolite. The EDX and SEM results confirmed that TiO2 was successfully loaded onto the surface of natural zeolite. The methylene blue method was used with UV-Vis spectrophotometry to determine the surface area of the composite. A value of 20.866 m2 g-1 was obtained, which indicated that the composite was a good catalyst. The band gap energy of the composite catalyst was 3.0132 eV, which confirmed the presence of TiO2. The photocatalyst allowed the esterification reaction of kapok seed oil to proceed at 35 \u00b0C under UV irradiation. This reaction led to biodiesel conversion. The chemical characteristics of the biodiesel produced were confirmed by GC-MS. Biodiesel properties such as kinematic viscosity, density, flash point and smoke point were determined. The results of the analyses showed that the biodiesel produced met all the specifications of the ASTM D6751 and ASTM D445 biodiesel standards.

The proximate compositions of S. macrophylla and S. palembanica seeds were 21.47% and 27.25% (moisture); 0.67% and 1.98% (ash); 41.37% and 49.06% (total lipid); 79.44% and 82.37% (total carbohydrate); 15.67% and 7.72% (crude fiber), respectively. Seeds of S. macrophylla and S. palembanica contained high levels of K (1186.50 and 400.17 mg/100 g), Ca (238.31 and 128.62 mg/100 g), Mg (300.50 and 117.17 mg/100 g), and Na (75.12 and 30.14 mg/100 g). The antinutritional factor phytate was detected in small concentrations in both species. At the same time, oxalate was found at a higher concentration in S. palembanica (2.43 mg/100 g) than in S. macrophylla (1.91 mg/100 g). The bioavailability of Ca and Zn influenced by antinutritional factors phytate and oxalate was calculated based on their molar ratios. The bioavailability of minerals affected by phytate did not exceed the critical value, suggesting adequate mineral absorption. However, high oxalate content exceeded the critical value of bioavailability (2.5), indicating insufficient mineral availability. SE was more efficient in extracting Shorea oils. Stearic, oleic and palmitic acids were the major fatty acids in S. macrophylla and S. palembanica oils, with no significant difference in fatty acid profiles between types of extraction (p>0.05). The acid (AV) and peroxide (PV) values of ME oils (AV: 3.47 to 4.75 mg NaOH/g; PV: 7.96 to 10.62 meq O2/kg) were lower than SE oils (AV: 4.69 to 8 mg NaOH/g; PV: 9.92 to 14.58 meq O2/kg). Therefore, mechanical extraction is considered the method of choice to extract Shorea oils. The iodine value (IV), AV, and PV of Shorea oils do not meet the required standards of the Indonesian National Standard (SNI) of Tengkawang butter and Cocoa Butter standards. Thus, a further refining process is suggested to increase the quality of S. macrophylla and S. palembanica oils.", "Published": "09 March 2023", "Issue": "Vol 25 No 1 (2023):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0042", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0042-3bc29d2"},

In this study, we performed a phytochemical analysis on the methanol, hexane and water extracts of C. nutans. Different chemical tests were used to screen for the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids and tannins in the extracts. The preliminary phytochemical screening showed that terpenoids were found in all extracts, while flavonoids and tannins were only found in the water extract, and saponins were only found in the methanol extract. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analyses confirmed that alkaloids were absent, but various flavonoids were present in all the extracts. In addition, all the extracts were able to inhibit the growth of S. aureus and B. subtilis, with zone of inhibition diameters of ~7-10 mm. However, no inhibition was observed for all extracts against E. coli. The MIC values for the water and methanol extracts against S. aureus were similar (12.50 mg/mL). Interestingly, the water extract was twice as effective (25.00 mg/mL) as the methanol extract (50.00 mg/mL) in inhibiting B. subtilis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for the hexane extract could not be determined as the extract precipitated after the addition of broth, which resulted in the formation of a cloudy solution.

Thermal ageing and TGA of the blends containing a high weight ratio of r-NBR suggested higher thermal stability, as they showed increased tensile properties and elongation at break as well as initiation of degradation at higher temperatures. This is because r-NBR consists of a crosslinking precursor and has greater thermal resistance. At similar blend ratios, it was observed that using ENR instead of NR as a blending component resulted in higher thermal stability. This is likely due to the higher thermal stability of ENR. Replacing epoxy rings on the rubber backbones gives ENR improved resistance to heat ageing.

The aim of this work was to isolate chemical constituents from the leaves of M. calabura and evaluate their antibacterial activity. Initially, the dried leaves were extracted with 95% ethanol, followed by water/ethyl acetate (EA) partitioning. The EA crude extract was then subjected to continuous column chromatography over silica gel. Anti-bacterial activity was determined by micro broth dilution. Ten known flavonoids comprising three flavanones {(2S,3S) 3,5-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone (FA1), (2R,3R) 3,5,7-trihydroxy-flavanone (FA2), (2S) 7,8-dihydroxyflavanone (FA3)}, three chalcones {2\u2019,4\u2019-dihydroxy-3\u2019-methoxychalcone (C1), 2\u2019,4\u2019-dihydroxychalcone (C2), 2\u2019,3\u2019,4\u2019-trihydroxychalcone (C3)} and four flavones {3,5-dihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavone (F1), 3,5,7-trihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone (F2), 5-hydroxy-3,7-dimethoxyflavone (F3), 5,7-dihydroxyflavone (F4)} were obtained from this work.

In this study, the 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde-4-(3-fluorophenyl) thiosemicarbazone (LH) ligand was synthesized from the reaction between 4-diphenylamino-benzaldehyde and 3-fluorophenyl thiosemicarbazide. The NiL2, CuL2, and CoL2 complexes containing the LH ligand were also synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductivity and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The LH ligand was characterized via 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. FTIR data was used to determine the coordination mode of the ligand with the Ni(II) metal ion. The FTIR spectra showed that LH behaved as a mononegative bidentate ligand with all metal ions, through its azomethine (N=C) and (C-S) groups. The electronic spectra and magnetic measurements suggest a square planar geometry for both the NiL2 and CuL2 complexes, with \u03bceff values of  0.00 and 2.36 B.M, respectively. However, CoL2 was likely to possess a tetrahedral geometry, with \u03bceff = 4.02 B.M.

Green technology is an alternative method to produce vanillin from vanilla pods and leaves with minimal energy consumption. In this paper, several non-conventional green methods to extract vanillin are reviewed, such as Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE), Microwave Pre-treatment (MW), Ultrasound Technology and Subcritical Water Extraction (SWE), and the advantages and limitations of each technique are discussed. Since these methods have some limitations, the green catalyst oxidation system is introduced as a safer method to treat the leaves to obtain a higher purity and better quality product. This new class of catalysts can destroy some of the worst pollutants before they get into the environment. \u2018Green catalysts\u2019 (Fe-TAML/H2O2) are used to recover natural compounds as an alternative to conventional methods and can prevent the formation of hazardous substances and clean-up steps.

The results showed that 100.0% degradation efficiency was achieved for an initial 2,4,6-TCP concentration of 10 ppm and reaction time of 25 minutes. Higher initial concentrations had lower degradation rates. The results also revealed that the degradation of 2,4,6-TCP fitted well with first order reaction kinetics, with an apparent rate constant of 0.0947 min-1 at an initial concentration of 10 ppm. The degradation of 2,4,6-TCP increased significantly with the increase in initial pH of the solution from pH 4 to pH 7 and then to pH 10. The highest degradation effect was found at pH 10.0 with a rate constant of 0.0443 min-1, which was attributed to the production of more powerful hydroxyl radicals. Evaluation of BOD5/COD ratios showed some enhancement in the biodegradability of the effluent treated by ozonation. A chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction of 42.10% was achieved after ozonation treatment and this result indicated that only partial mineralization of 2,4,6-TCP could be achieved by ozonation alone. These findings suggest that future studies should focus on the application of catalytic ozonation or a combination of ozonation with other conventional treatments such as biodegradation or filtration in order to achieve complete degradation of this toxic organic contaminant.", "Published": "29 September 2022", "Issue": "Vol 24 No 3 (2022):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0040", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0040-873e94a"},

Specifically, resveratrol synthase (STS, EC 2.3.1.95) condenses three malonyl-CoA molecules and one coumaroyl-CoA molecule to form resveratrol. The oligostilbenoid compounds are mostly derived from the oligomerization of resveratrol via oxidative coupling reaction followed by several secondary reactions such as cyclization, enolization and oxidation. Stilbenoids isolated from the genus Gnetum, however, are rather small, and mainly consist of monomers and dimers. The diversity of the structure of monomers found in Gnetum other than resveratrol, also contributed to the oligomerization of oligostilbenoids isolated from the genus. This study focused on the isolation of stilbenoid compounds from Gnetum species using various chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, together with their biosynthesis pathways, their Prostaglandin E2 inhibitory activities via radioimmunoassay method and structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. The phytochemical study on the lianas of Gnetum microcapum has led to the isolation of 11 compounds.

Maternal diabetes mellitus is proposed to be responsible for impaired reproductive outcomes by increasing reactive oxygen species production, leading to oxidative stress. However, there is little evidence of whether TRF supplementation can prevent impaired reproductive outcomes in maternal diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of palm-TRF on the quality and development of embryos and blood glucose levels in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic female mice. Forty, six-week-old female Mus musculus mice were divided into five groups: Group 1: Non-diabetic control, Group 2: STZ-induced diabetic without TRF supplementation, Group 3: Non-diabetic vehicle control, Group 4: Non-diabetic with TRF supplementation and Group 5: STZ-induced diabetic with TRF supplementation. Following induction of diabetes (by a single dose of STZ (40 mg/kg BW) given intraperitoneally for 7 days), mice were administered TRF (150 mg/kg BW) by oral gavage daily for 14 days. At the end of the treatment period, mice from all groups were superovulated, mated, and then euthanized. Embryos were retrieved and cultured. The morphology and in vitro development of embryos were monitored and recorded, and blood glucose level was analyzed. Both the percentage of normal embryos and development to the blastocyst stage was lower (p<0.05) in STZ-induced diabetic mice compared to that of the controls (Group 1). TRF supplementation was able to restore the percentage of normal embryos and their development in diabetic mice. However, two weeks of TRF supplementation was not able to reduce the blood glucose levels in STZ-induced diabetic mice. In conclusion, 150 mg/kg BW TRF supplementation for two weeks was able to overcome the diabetic-induced oxidative stress damage on the embryos and maintain their developmental capacity.

Diospyros Adenophora (Ebenaceae) is a shrub or tree grown primarily in the wet tropical biome including Peninsula Malaysia. The species of Diospyros have been reported to exhibit interesting biological properties such as antimalaria. Interestingly, no scientific report was documented on the species D. adenophora. In the present study, three known pentacyclic triterpenoids namely lupenone (1), lupeol (2), and betulin (3) were isolated from this species and fully characterized using extensive spectroscopic data like 1D- and 2D- nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as well as FT-IR and HRESIMS and subsequently compared with the reported literature. All compounds were screened in vitro for anti-malarial activity against \u03b2-hematin polymerization inhibition as well as molecular docking.

The metabolites in the leaves of M. koenigii have been studied extensively for its pharmacological properties, revealing a diverse range of its therapeutic effects. This study aimed to investigate the metabolites in the leaf, bark, and root of M. koenigii using a combination of Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Chromatography (LC-MS/MS) and molecular networking as a dereplication strategy for the detection of potential new compounds. The comprehensive metabolite profiling of the M. koenigii dichloromethane extracts was carried out by generating a molecular network from LC-MS/MS data. A total of 47 known compounds and 11 unknown compounds were putatively identified based on their molecular structure obtained from the analysis of the MN. There were six clusters in the MN by which five clusters were composed of alkaloids and one cluster was consisted of terpenoids. The present study suggested that three alkaloid compounds putatively identified for the first time in the bark and root of M. koenigii might appear to be potential bioactive compounds deserving of further investigation. The two compounds, (1-(4-ethoxybutyl)-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl) (p-tolyl) methanone (peak 2) and 1,4-bis(3-phenylpropyl)-1,2-dihydropyridine (peak 4), were found exclusively in the bark, whereas 2-methyl-4,6-bis(4-(pyridin-4-yl) phenyl)-1,3,5-triazin (peak 3) was found abundantly in the root.

The effect on replication phases of HSV-1 was determined by time-of-addition and time-of-removal assays. Time-of-addition assay showed the extract inhibits 70% of the virus at 2 hours post infection (hpi). In time-of-removal assay, treatment with extract caused 20% reduction of plaque formation as early as 2 hpi and reached more than 80% after 16 hpi. Gene expression analysis by quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) using selected primers was done to investigate the level of gene transcript at different replication phases of HSV-1 which included immediate early genes (UL54), early gene (UL30), and late gene (UL27). The result showed that transcript levels of these genes in infected cells treated with S. polyanthum extract were reduced compared to infected cells without treatment.

Additionally, we evaluated the activity of B. frutescens on xanthine oxidase inhibitory assay to ensure the quality of the raw material. The concentrations of specific biomarker, 6-methyl quercetin and also myricitrin were quantified in the samples processed at different drying temperatures and harvesting time. The results revealed significant variations in the concentrations of the biomarker in relation to the harvesting time and drying temperature. The highest percentage of 6-methyl quercetin (0.14%) was observed at the optimum drying temperature of 60\u00b0C.

Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH) is a gene necessary for the survival of plasmodium parasites and is a potential antimalarial target. Our objective was to discover goniothalamin and its twenty-nine analogues as potent antimalarial molecules with pfLDH inhibitory activity effective against resistant strains of plasmodium parasites.

There has been limited research conducted thus far regarding the chemical constituents and bioactivities of this genus. Hence, Dipterocarpus kerrii was selected to be phytochemically studied as well as to evaluate the radical scavenging properties of the crude extract. The twigs of D. kerrii were collected from Jengka Forest Reserve, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Pahang and air-dried for two weeks before being ground to granulated form. The granules (650 g) were macerated in acetone, followed by filtration and evaporation to give a crude acetone extract. The crude acetone extract (178 g) was subjected to fractionation and purification by vacuum liquid chromatography and column chromatography respectively to afford two resveratrol oligomers namely (+)-\u03b1-viniferin (1) (12 mg) and (-)-laevifonol (2) (5 mg). In addition, the crude acetone extract that was tested against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals exhibited potent radical scavenging activities with the IC50 values of 11.20 \u00b1 0.54 and 32.37 \u00b1 0.28 \u00b5g/mL, respectively.", "Published": "26 February 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 1 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0048", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0048-732fd78"},

Blume (S. crispa) is a well-known folklore medicinal plant traditionally used in Malaysia and Indonesia for its diverse range of traditional applications and medicinal properties. While previous studies have established its effectiveness as an anticancer agent against various cancer types, its impact on skin cancer cells remains largely unexplored. In this study, ethanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of S. crispa were screened for phytochemicals and analyzed for their photocytotoxicity against the A431 human skin squamous carcinoma cell line by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenultetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In general, the qualitative analysis indicated the presence of terpenes, alkaloids, phenols, quinones, and chlorophylls in all three crude extracts, while steroids, flavonoids, and anthraquinones were not detected. Upon activation with photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment, the cell viability decreased. Among the extracts, the hexane crude extract exhibited the highest photocytotoxic activity against the A431 cell line, with an IC50 value of 6.06 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b5g/mL, followed by the ethanolic crude extract (IC50 = 8.83 \u00b1 0.55 \u00b5g/mL) and the ethyl acetate crude extract (IC50 = 9.37 \u00b1 0.71 \u00b5g/mL). However, when tested without PDT treatment, none of the three crude extracts exhibited significant activity against the A431 cell line, even at concentrations as high as 200 \u03bcg/mL after 24 hours of incubation in the dark. The results of the present study suggest that S. crispa could serve as a valuable source of photosensitizing agents for photodynamic therapy in cancer treatment.", "Published": "26 February 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 1 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0048", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0048-6a2f632"},

Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is among the modern extraction techniques to extract natural chemical components such as flavonoids, essential oils, carotenoids, and fatty acids, and it is a more sustainable alternative to conventional extraction procedures. In this study, the stem bark of Anisoptera laevis was extracted using SFE and maceration techniques. Stilbenoids are a class of polyphenolic compounds that are rich in bioactivities. It is a secondary metabolite that plays an important role as a defensive mechanism in plants. This research aimed to extract stilbenoids from the stem bark of A. laevis using maceration and SFE techniques and compare the extraction of stilbenoids using both approaches. The LOTUS and MassBank of North America (MoNA) databases identified seventy peaks from each maceration and SFE crude extract with MS/MS values. In maceration and SFE crude extracts, nine stilbenoids were found, with two more peaks detected in maceration crude extract. The results for both extraction procedures are almost comparable, implying that SFE could be considered an option for the greener extraction method with a shorter period.", "Published": "26 February 2024", "Issue": "Vol 26 No 1 (2024):  Malaysian Journal of Chemistry ", "Issue_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/abstract-listing.php?jid=J0048", "Research_PDF_Link": "https://ikm.org.my/publications/malaysian-journal-of-chemistry/view-pdf.php?idx=J0048-fa3ab7e"}
